    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li><br><br>
        <li><span class="linethrough bolder">CSS is not necessary </span><span class="bolder yellow">CSS saves a lot of work</span>.
            It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br><br>
        <li class="underline ">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="red">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
        <ul type="disk">
            <li class="letterspacing">Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1
            </li>
            <li class="letterspacing">Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
            <li class="letterspacing">External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
            <li class="letterspacing">The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS <span class="yellow">
                    however, in this tutitorial
                    we will use inline and internal styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for
                you to try
                it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fontfamily">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on
            the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to
            link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
            <p class="lighter">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
            <p class="fontw">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
